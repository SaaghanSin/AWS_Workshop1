#### Download library
For some library that lambda does not support, we will have to create a layer contain library to run.
1. Go to [Lambda Layers](https://github.com/kuharan/Lambda-Layers) make by **kuruhan**, whichis a collection of pre-built AWS Lambda layers for Python. It provides a variety of libraries that you can directly use in your Lambda functions.

2. From the table of content, download the need library package for your lambda function and choose the runtime version. In this workshop, we will use **Request** library with **Python 3.8** runtime.
