In today's data-driven world, the ability to automatically ingest, process, and analyze data is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions. AWS provides a comprehensive set of tools that allow developers and data engineers to build scalable, reliable, and secure data pipelines with ease. This workshop will guide you through the process of building a basic data pipeline using key AWS services such as Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch.

The focus of this lab is to demonstrate how you can automate the process of crawling data from a web source, storing it in an S3 bucket, and triggering subsequent actions based on the data arrival using CloudWatch. By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how to:

- Utilize AWS Lambda to crawl and process web data.
- Store and manage data efficiently in Amazon S3.
- Automate pipeline triggers using CloudWatch events.
- Secure and manage your data pipeline using AWS's built-in tools.
- This hands-on experience will provide you with the foundational knowledge needed to extend and customize your data pipelines for more complex use cases, enabling your organization to efficiently handle large volumes of data with minimal manual intervention.

In the subsequent sections, we'll cover the prerequisites and preparation needed to get started, followed by step-by-step instructions to build and deploy your data pipeline.
